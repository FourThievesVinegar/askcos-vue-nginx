              Here, we have hosted a number of computational tools to assist in
              synthetic planning and other aspects of organic chemistry. These
              are listed and described in the Modules tab in the top navigation
              bar. Please keep in mind that this service is supported by a fixed
              amount of computational resources. Your requests may take
              significantly longer than expected if there are several other
              users on the site also performing computationally-expensive
              requests.

              This work began under the DARPA Make-It program (ARO
              W911NF-16-2-0023) and continues to be supported by the Machine
              Learning for Pharmaceutical Discovery and Synthesis Consortium. The main
              algorithms for Monte Carlo Tree Search used in the Tree Builder are
              adapted from
